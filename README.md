Website for [sqlfluff](http://www.sqlfluff.com/), based on [startbootstrap-small-business template](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-small-business).

## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

NB: If the `vendor` folder isn't updating, try removing the `dist` folder altogether and then rerunning `npm start`.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.

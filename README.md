# sqlfluff.com

Website for [sqlfluff](http://www.sqlfluff.com/), based on [startbootstrap-small-business template](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-small-business).

*NB:* This site is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Contributions

This repository is private to just org members, but contributions are still very welcome
from that group. Please raise issues and PRs for anything you normally would, from anything
from CI/CD and infrastructure through to docs, usability and content.

## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

NB: If the `vendor` folder isn't updating, try removing the `dist` folder altogether and then rerunning `npm start`.

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
